# 🖼️ Image Renaming Script

## 📝 Description
This is a simple Python script that renames all files in a specified directory to a specific naming scheme (e.g., "image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", etc.). This can be useful for organizing files in large directories.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Python 3.6 or higher

### ⬇️ Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd your_repo`

## 🎯 Usage
1. Open `image_rename.py` in a text editor.
2. Modify the `folder_path` variable with the path to the directory containing the files you want to rename.
3. Modify the word image in this string [f"image{i+1}.jpg"] to the name you want. Eg. if you want the name to be egg, it becomes [f"egg{i+1}.jpg"].
